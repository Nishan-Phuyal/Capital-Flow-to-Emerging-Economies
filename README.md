Capital Flow Data: A Guide for Empirical Analysis and Real-Time Tracking

Robin Koepke and Simon Paetzoldâ€™s remarkable work has provided valuable insights for academics and policymakers exploring the determinants of capital flow to emerging economies. In this interactive visualization app, I present three insightful graphs for examining capital flows to these markets.

1.	Time Lapse View of Net Capital Flows on geo-_map: This feature illustrates the gradual globalization of capital investment, showcasing the impact of significant global economic events on capital flows to emerging markets (EMEs).

2.	Interactive exploration. This feature allows Users to interactively explore the time series data by specifying dates or individual economies.

3.	Cross-Border Correlation Matrix: This graph depicts historical pairwise correlation coefficients, indicating potential spillover effects between multiple economies. While this phenomenon is commonly observed in empirical analysis, the correlation coefficient alone is a weak measure for comprehensive interpretation, opening avenues for deeper inferential exploration.
